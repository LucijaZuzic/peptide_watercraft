Figure~\ref{fig:var_direction_RMSE} represents the $p$-values for the Wilcoxon signed-rank test on RMSE values across $k$-fold validation datasets for the heading in the $k$-fold testing datasets using different RNN models, and forecasting times. Darker colors in grayscale represent a higher $p$-value in a range from $0$ to $1$. The values on the secondary diagonal are all equal to $1$ and black because models equal themselves.
